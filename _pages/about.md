Hi, I am Atri Vivek Sharma, a PhD Student conducting research on Safe and Trusted Artificial Intelligence at Imperial College London.

My research interests lie in making Machine Learning algorithms safer - particularly in robustness and interpretability, to ultimately mitigate the major safety risks posed by the rapid development of AI technologies. 

Before my PhD, I was at Pangaea Data, a London-based startup focussed on applying AI within healthcare, where I led the development of an Natural Language Processing (NLP) product pipeline to identify at-risk or undiagnosed patients with specific diseases. My experience of using AI in health highlighted the pressing need of developing more robust and interpretable ML systems, that can be trusted by experts to make critical decisions.
